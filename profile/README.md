## 🙋‍♀️ About Us

Onclick Cooperative is built on the simple premise that when we don't have to pay shareholders, we all win:

- 🌟 **100% Worker-Owned** - Every team member is an equal owner in our co-op
- 💰 **75% Worker Revenue** - The majority of revenue goes directly to members
- 🤝 **Direct Partnership** - Work directly with the people building your project
- 📈 **Collective Growth** - Our success is shared among all worker-owners

## 👩‍💻 Our Tech Stack

We build modern web applications using a carefully selected stack:

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Deno + Oak, tRPC
- **Development**: ESLint, Vite, SSG for static generation
